quasicrystals, fractals and more
==================

Have fun playing with these trippy visualizations.

Quasicrystals
---------

[`/index.html`](https://peddie.github.io/quasicrystals-webgl/index.html)

Press `?` for a help message and information on keybindings.

This one will prompt you to attach your mic, but the sound integration
doesn't add much at the moment, and you might be just as happy leaving
it off.

### Planned features:

 - better sound algorithm
 - save/reload

Mandelbrot
---------

[`/fractal.html`](https://peddie.github.io/quasicrystals-webgl/fractal.html)

Press `?` for a help message and information on keybindings.

The sound integration on this one is better.  I get better results
with music when I set Pulseaudio to the "monitor" input, i.e. only the
music that's playing, without any mic; I encourage you to do the same
if your audio system can.

If you get bored, try changing color schemes with `c` or fractal power
with `]`.

### Planned features:

 - Automatic pan/zoom pattern
 - Automatic color cycling
 - save/reload
