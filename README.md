quasicrystals, fractals and more
==================

Have fun playing with these trippy visualizations.

Quasicrystals
---------

    /index.html

Press `?` for a help message and information on keybindings.

This one will prompt you to attach your mic, but the sound integration
doesn't add much at the moment, and you might be just as happy leaving
it off.

### Planned features:

 - better sound algorithm
 - save/reload

Mandelbrot
---------

    /fractal.html

Press `?` for a help message and information on keybindings.

The sound integration on this one is better.

If you get bored, try changing color schemes with `c` or fractal power
with `]`.

### Planned features:

 - Automatic pan/zoom pattern
 - Automatic color cycling
 - save/reload
